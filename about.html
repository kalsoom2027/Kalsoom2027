            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Kalsoom Fatima. I am majoring in <em>Landscape Architecture</em> at 
            the <strong>University of Rhode Island</strong> class of 2027.<br>
            I signed up for CSC 106 because I'm interested in minoring in Data Science and wanted to take a basic programming class first.<br>
            I graduated <a href="https://chsw.cpsed.net/">Cranston High School West</a> in 2023 where I took a website designing class and
            a Computer Animation class. We<br> used <a href="https://www.weebly.com/"> Weebly</a> and <a href="https://www.wix.com/"> Wix</a>
            for the Website Design Class and a software called Maya 8.5 for the Animation class. I have also just<br> recently joined the 
            Memorial Union IT Service Desk as a Student Information Technologist. 
            </p>
            <p> I have been living in Rhode Island for the past 5 years, but I am originally from <strong>Pakistan</strong>. I am multilingual as I am fluent in<br>
            English, Urdu, Punjabi, and Hindi. I also took 4 years of Spanish in high school but I can't say that I'm fluent in Spanish. I like<br>
            reading, cooking and watching movies in my free time. My favorite book of all time is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kite_Runner"><em>The Kite Runner</em></a> and favorite film series<br>
            is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia_(film_series)"><em>The Chronicles of Narnia.</em></a> I love cooking Pakistani/Indian cuisine and my favorite dishes are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biryani">Biryani</a>
            and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panipuri"> Panipuri</a>.
